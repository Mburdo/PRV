# Calibration Report: Phase 0 (Foundation)

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Beads | 10/10 closed |
| ACs Implemented | 8/11 (73%) |
| Tests | 24 passing |
| North Star Alignment | 5/5 |
| Status | **APPROVED** |

## What Was Built

### Core Components

| Crate | Purpose | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `prv` | CLI binary | Working (`prv debug cass`) |
| `prv-core` | Code block extraction | 16 tests passing |
| `prv-cass` | CASS database access | 7 tests passing |

### Key Functionality

1. **Cargo Workspace** - Multi-crate Rust project structure
2. **Code Block Parser** - Extracts from:
   - Triple backticks (```lang)
   - 4-space indented blocks
   - Unified diff format (+lines)
3. **CASS Integration** - Reads SQLite (17 workspaces, 545 sessions)
4. **CLI** - `prv debug cass` validates integration

## Deferred Items

| AC | Description | Why Deferred |
|----|-------------|--------------|
| AC-003.4 | File path extraction near code blocks | Part of fingerprinting (Phase 1) |
| AC-004.3 | Workspace caching | Performance optimization |
| AC-004.4 | Nested git repo handling | Edge case, caller provides root |

These are appropriate deferrals - not missing functionality for Phase 0.

## North Star Check

| Principle | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Rust implementation | ALIGNED |
| CASS read-only | ALIGNED |
| LSP primary (foundation) | ALIGNED |
| CLI secondary | ALIGNED |
| Building toward fingerprinting | ALIGNED |

No drift detected.

## Test Evidence

```
cargo test
  prv:      1 passed
  prv-cass: 7 passed (2 ignored - integration)
  prv-core: 16 passed
  Total:    24 passed

cargo run -- debug cass
  Status: Connected
  Workspaces: 17
  Sessions: 545
```

---

## Recommendation

**PROCEED TO PHASE 1**

Phase 0 Foundation is complete. All exit criteria met:
- `cargo build` produces `prv` binary
- `prv debug cass` shows session count
- Unit tests pass for code block parser
- Can extract code blocks from CASS messages

---

## Next Steps

Phase 1 (Fingerprinting & Linking) will:
- Implement hunk fingerprinting (ADR-001)
- Link commits to sessions
- Build the PRV index
